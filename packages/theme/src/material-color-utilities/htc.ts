/**
 * A color system built using CAM16 hue and chroma, and L* from
 * L*a*b*.
 *
 * Using L* creates a link between the color system, contrast, and thus
 * accessibility. Contrast ratio depends on relative luminance, or Y in the XYZ
 * color space. L*, or perceptual luminance can be calculated from Y.
 *
 * Unlike Y, L* is linear to human perception, allowing trivial creation of
 * accurate color tones.
 *
 * Unlike contrast ratio, measuring contrast in L* is linear, and simple to
 * calculate. A difference of 40 in HCT tone guarantees a contrast ratio >= 3.0,
 * and a difference of 50 guarantees a contrast ratio >= 4.5.
